   <h2>Property Value Blog Post 3- School Districts and Prices</h2>
   <h5>The second step, March 11, 2021</h5>
   <p> My final objective was to analyze property value by city and by school district. To examine property value by city, I had to take several steps. To answer my question about school district and property values, the very first step that I took was to create a variable for the columns “PRICE” and “SCHOOLDESC”, grouped by school district, from my dataframe. After that, I plotted the average price per school district on a bar graph using PANDA’s inbuilt graphing function. </p>
   <p> The steps I followed were as follows(although steps 1 thrugh 2 were in one line of code) </p>
<ol>
   <li> First I selected two columns from my dataframe, Price and School Districts </li>
   <li> Then I grouped that selection by school district and calculated the average by school district </li>
   <li> Finally, I graphed it. </li>
 </ol>

   <p> One thing that you might immediately notice is that three cities(Witaker, Whiteoak, Westview) seem to have either extremely low prices or nothing.
     This likely meanas one of two things, they have a very low average home cost or there was a programming mistake. So to check this, I decided to calculate the average for each city</p>

    <p> As you can see, the average sale value of the Homes in Witaker, Whiteoak and Westview that are included in this dataset are actually quite low. Still, it's good practice to check because everyone makes mistakes </p>
    <p> The next thing I did was track how the average property value per school district changed over time. </p>
    <ol>
      <li> The first thing I did was create a variable that had three columns of my dataframe selected(price, saledate, and school district)</li>
      <li> My second step was to make a subplot statement so that I could easily adjust the size of the plot </li>
      <li>  Steps three through four are more about breaking down one line of code. And my third step was to group my variable by it's saledate and price, and then calculate the average</li>
      <li> Lastly, I used unstack to make sure that the school districts were graphed individually, instead of cumulatively. Then I plotted it(this is displayed below) </li>
    </ol>
