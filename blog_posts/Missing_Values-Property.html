      <p>Coming into this analysis of property values, I had three main elements that I wanted to investigate
<ol>
  <li>How much the price of properties in PA changed approximately 8 years. </li>
  <li>How much property values changed in PA per city </li>
      <li>And the average price of a home per school district </li>
      </ol>
<p>	Before I discuss my questions for this dataset and how I approached answering them, I’m going to list it’s basic properties. The Property-Values dataset had 307755 individual entries across 23 columns. The columns included were Property-House-Number, Property-Fraction, Property-Address-Dir, Property-Address-Street, Property-Address-Suf, Property-Address-Unit-Desc, Property-Unit-Number, Property-City, Property-State, Property-Zip, School-Code, School-Desc, Municipal-Code, Municipal-District, Recorded-Date, Sale-Date, price, DeedBook, DeedPage, SaleCode, Sale-Desc, Instrument Type, Instrument Description. </p>


<p> To process this data into a usable form, some extra steps had to be taken. The property-sales dataset that I was working with had not been cleaned, it was a raw dataset. This dataset had some missing data points (most notably in the Price column) which had to be addressed before I commenced with any analysis. In my dataset, missing data was indicated by ‘NaN’(as pictured below) </p>

      <p>  I decided to address this  issue by using imputation to replace the missing values with the mean(https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/handling-missing-values) </p>
